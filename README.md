A community-generated pool of opensource resources useful for angineers/developers intrested in contributing t opensource. 

Contributing to open-source projects has proved to be an excellent way to learn as a developer. To test and share knowledge with other coders. With each contribution, you gain experience. 

The OSCA -Nairobi has put together repositories that can help you contribute to opensource. Projects of all languages, platforms and levels of difficulty. 

### Why contribute to opensource
## social and organizational skills
- Developing a sense of context: understanding how development work is embedded within a project's scope, mission, team of co-developers, and new forms of leadership;
- Interacting with a project's global and diverse community;
- Negotiating feature requests, requirements, and implementation choices;
- Dealing with communication problems, such as absent responses, which are common in volunteer-run projects;
- Appreciating the software as a product through practices such as issue triaging and release planning; and
- Receiving, discussing, and addressing code review comments.
## tech skills
- Navigating through a project's assets, such as software code, issues, documentation, and pull requests;
- Evaluating swiftly the product and process quality of software systems or components, as is often required in modern software reuse;
- Configuring, building, running, and debugging third-party code;
- Setting up and running software intensive systems with diverse software and hardware requirements. In the course I run, these have included mobile phones, car electronics, application servers, databases, containers, IoT equipment, and embedded devices;
- Choosing realistic contribution goals. (Initially students tend to wildly overestimate their ability to contribute to a project.) This is a key activity in agile development sprints;
- Reading third-party code to identify where their additions or fixes need to be made;
- Modifying a large third-party system by adding a new feature or fixing a bug;
- Writing tests that demonstrate a contribution is working as expected now and into the future;
- Working with software systems developed using multiple programming languages and tools; students are often surprised to find out that knowledge of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is by no means a passport for contributing to a project;
- Documenting their work, typically using a declarative markup language, for example Markdown or documentation generator code comments;
- Following sophisticated configuration management (version control) workflows, such as working on issue branches and rebasing code commits; and
- Passing pre-commit and continuous integration checks and tests.

This assumes that you are familiar with using version control. That you have a solid understanding of a programming language. If you are new, I suggest this link to help you better grasp git and GitHub. 

Finding beginner-friendly projects
- Check for labels: Open source projects have labels that you can use to identify projects.
- Lists
- Resources: Listed below are projects that you can contribute to.
