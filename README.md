# OpenSourceResources

Contributing to open-source projects has proved to be an excellent way to learn as a developer. To test and share knowledge with other coders. With each contribution, you gain experience. 

The OSCA -Nairobi has put together repositories that can help you contribute to opensource. Projects of all languages, platforms and levels of difficulty. 

This assumes that you are familiar with using version control. That you have a solid understanding of a programming language. If you are new, I suggest this link to help you better grasp git and GitHub. 

Finding beginner-friendly projects
- Check for labels: Open source projects have labels that you can use to identify projects.
- Lists
- Resources: Listed below are projects that you can contribute to. 

## First-timers
