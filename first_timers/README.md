# What is Open Source?
Let's address the elephant in the room that is *“What is Open-Source?”*.

First, let's get clear about Open-Source Software.

"Open-source software is made by many people and distributed under an OSD-compliant license which grants all the rights to use, study, change and share the software is modified and unmodified form. Software freedom is essential to enabling community development of open-source software."

Open Source Software is not only free but also lets you access its source code. They let you understand the code. You can use the code in your project, can edit the project, and after editing, can distribute under a different license.

If a project is open-source, other developers can contribute to it through platforms like GitHub(I will discuss GitHub in a later part). The idea of helping other developer’s projects is forming an open-source community. This community is growing, helping, and impacting the development of software.
Two words most commonly attached to the open-source community are Git and GitHub. Let’s look at these.

## Git

Suppose you are working in a group of developers on a single project. There is an original project file (let's called it master). Each developer has a duplicate copy of the master, and everyone is working on different features. After each developer has completed his work, it's time to add the source code to the master.

If everyone adds the code to master without knowing each other’s code, then there can be an issue such as

Different structure of code.

Some features will work, and some won’t.

Create complexity in the source code.

If the code isn't backup, then it will hard to roll back changes.

To solve such a problem, Git comes to rescue the developers.

Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

In Git, version control tracks down every change in any file, which can be easily pushed to master. Since every change is tracked down, it becomes easy to go back to the previous code if there is a bug in the new code; otherwise, there will be a lot of trouble in manually removing code, making it compatible with the previous code again.

With the help of Git, every developer can work on a different branch and, after approval, can merge into master.

## GitHub
Git provides control over the source code, and GitHub is a platform which uses git version control to upload open source project to theirs cloud for sharing code to others. Git is local, and GitHub is cloud-based.

GitHub as a platform has helped developers in many ways, such as

Sharing code with other developers.

Collaborating with other developers around the world.

Discussing ideas and features for the project.

Other people can report an issue.

Some developers can work on the issue.

And Many More.
